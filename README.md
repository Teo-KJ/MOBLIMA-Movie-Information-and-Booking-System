# MOBLIMA-Movie-Information-and-Booking-System
The MOvie-Booking-and-LIsting-Management-Application or MOBLIMA system for short. This is a personal project on object-oriented programming concepts. This project is an adaptation of a school project (You can see the original work [here](https://github.com/wilsonteng97/MOBLIMA-An-Object-Oriented-Project-for-CZ2002)) which I have worked with my fellow group mates. After the project, I decided to develop my own MOBLIMA system to test my understanding of object-oriented programming. In addition, I developed my own algorithm to do the processing of movie information and booking of movie tickets.

# Features of the system

## 1. Web Crawling to get the latest movie details

With python modules of Beautiful Soup and Regular Expression, extracted the latest movie on show in Singapore from this [website](http://www.cinemaonline.sg/movies/nowshowing.aspx). This allows the administrator from spending time in manually adding the movies. However, the staff can also manually add and remove the movies if necessary. 

## 2. Easy access of staff and customer accounts

With the Java modules of FileInputStream, able to store the accounts in String data type into txt files for easy access and reading. User of the program can view the txt files easily.
