# MOBLIMA-Movie-Information-and-Booking-System
The MOvie-Booking-and-LIsting-Management-Application or MOBLIMA system for short. This is a personal project on object-oriented programming concepts. This project is an adaptation of a school project (You can see the original work [here](https://github.com/wilsonteng97/MOBLIMA-An-Object-Oriented-Project-for-CZ2002)) which I have worked with my fellow group mates. After the project, I decided to develop my own MOBLIMA system to test my understanding of object-oriented programming. In addition, I developed my own algorithm to do the processing of movie information and booking of movie tickets.
